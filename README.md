# Updated code for Module 1 by Kevin Lam
The changes reflect an editing of certain CSS elements that were being used but was divided into 3 seperate classes, when it could be condensed into 1. 

In HTML there were several points where a class and id were both being called, however there was no ID function in the CSS so it was removed. 

Majority of work was done in cutting out redundant code. However left in code commented out so that it can be seen/ in case we return and want to utilize at a later date. 

Also hello grader! Thank you for looking at my code, I hope you have a good day!
